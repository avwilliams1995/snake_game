# Snake Game

## Overview

This repository contains the code for a classic Snake Game built using Python's Turtle graphics module. The game allows players to control a snake as it navigates a grid, collecting food to grow longer. The game ends when the snake runs into itself or the wall.

## Features

- **Classic Gameplay**: Navigate the snake to collect food and grow longer while avoiding collisions with walls and the snake's own body.

- **Simple Graphics**: Built using Python's Turtle module for simple and intuitive graphics.
